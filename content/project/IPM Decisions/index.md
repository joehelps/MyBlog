[IPM Decisions](https://www.ipmdecisions.net/) is an [EU H2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en) project, designed to facilitate the uptake of decision support tools.

The project, headed by ADAS, involves numerous research organisations around Europe.

My part is developing methods to estimate the value of decision support tools.
