abstract: Insect management strategies for agricultural crop pests must reduce selection for insecticide resistant mutants 
  while providing effective control of the insect pest. One management strategy that has long been advocated is the 
  application of insecticides at the maximum permitted dose. This has been found, under some circumstances, to be able 
  to prevent the resistance allele frequency from increasing. However this approach may, under different circumstances, 
  lead to rapid selection for resistance to the insecticide. To test when a high dose would be an effective resistance management strategy, 
  we present a flexible deterministic model of a population of an insect pest of agricultural crops. 
  The model includes several possible life-history traits including sexual or asexual reproduction, diploid or haplodiploid 
  genetics, univoltine or multivoltine life cycle, so that the high dose strategy can be tested for many different in- sect pests. 
  Using this model we aim to identify the key characteristics of pests that make either a high dose or a low dose of 
  insecticide optimal for resistance management.
  Two outputs are explored, firstly whether the frequency of the resistance allele increases over time or remains low indefinitely; 
  and secondly whether lowering the dose of insecticide applied reduces or increases the rate of selection for the resistance allele. 
  It is demonstrated that with high immigration resistance can be suppressed. 
  This suppression however, is rarely lost if the insecticide dose is reduced, and is absent altogether when individuals move 
  from the treated population back into an untreated population. 
  Reducing the dose of insecticide often resulted in slower development of resistance, except where the population combined a high 
  influx of less resistant individuals into the treated population, a recessive resistance gene and a high efficacy, in which case 
  reducing the dose of insecticide could result in faster selection for resistance.
